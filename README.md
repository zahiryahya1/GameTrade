# GameTrade
A online platform where people can trade games that they dont play for ones that they want to play.

## notes

- Set up system and connected to mongodb using mongoose.
- used loginapp as a foundation to create accounts and login. 
- created a js function that used axios js to convert address into lat and lng using google maps api when the user registers
- use bcrypt to hash password
- use passport to authenticate user
- 


## known bugs/issues

- need to check if the address is a correct address when the user registers
